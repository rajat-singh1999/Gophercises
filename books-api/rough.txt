next feature additions:

-> add aditional field to books to keep track of capacity(or some other name)
        -> the main motive is to stop deletion of a book from the database if some copies of that book have been currently issued to users

-> prevent deletion of users if they have books issued to their name

-> userUpdate route, accessible to user and admin
        -> user can only update their data
                -> can update email, password, username
                -> email and username can only be updated if no collisions with other users
        -> admin can update all users data, one at a time

-> set expiration time of JWT tokens

-> middleware for validating incoming json on all routes

-> convert the entire database thing from json files to mongoDB

-> add a simple frontend

-> schema implimentation of api responses(response header, body, etc)
